## üéØ RISK MITIGATION STRATEGY

### ‚öñÔ∏è **Legal & IP Risks**

#### **Patent Prosecution Risks:**
- **Risk**: Patent applications rejected or limited in scope
- **Mitigation**: File multiple continuation applications, broad + narrow claims strategy
- **Contingency**: Trade secret protection for specific implementations

#### **Freedom to Operate Risks:**
- **Risk**: Infringement on existing patents (Google, competitors)
- **Mitigation**: Comprehensive FTO analysis, defensive patent strategy
- **Contingency**: Design-around alternatives, licensing negotiations

### üè¢ **Technical & Commercial Risks**

#### **Genie 3 Dependency Risk:**
- **Risk**: Genie 3 API access restrictions or pricing changes
- **Mitigation**: Multi-provider strategy (backup world generation approaches)
- **Contingency**: In-house world generation using Stable Diffusion + LLMs

#### **Market Adoption Risk:**
- **Risk**: Slow enterprise adoption of world-based training
- **Mitigation**: Extensive pilot programs, ROI demonstration
- **Contingency**: Hybrid approach (traditional + world-based options)

### üí∞ **Financial Risks**

#### **Development Cost Overruns:**
- **Risk**: Technical complexity exceeds budget
- **Mitigation**: Phased development, MVP approach, regular milestone reviews
- **Contingency**: Simplified first version, iterate based on customer feedback

#### **Competitive Response:**
- **Risk**: Major players develop competing solutions
- **Mitigation**: Patent protection, first-mover advantage, cultural specialization
- **Contingency**: Focus on Argentina/LatAm markets with cultural moat
